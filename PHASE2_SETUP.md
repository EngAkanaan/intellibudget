# Phase 2: Authentication & Database Setup

## Step 1: Create Supabase Account & Project

1. **Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)**
2. **Sign up** (free account)
3. **Create a new project:**
   - Name: `intellibudget`
   - Database Password: (save this securely!)
   - Region: Choose closest to you
   - Click "Create new project"
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for setup

4. **Get your API credentials:**
   - Go to Project Settings → API
   - Copy these values (we'll use them next):
     - **Project URL** (e.g., `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
     - **anon public key** (starts with `eyJ...`)

## Step 2: Run Database Schema

Once you have your Supabase project, we'll provide the SQL to create all tables.

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

We'll install the Supabase client library.

## Step 4: Implementation

We'll create:
- Authentication system
- Database integration
- Migrate from localStorage to Supabase
